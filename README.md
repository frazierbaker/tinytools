# tinytools
Frazier Baker

This is a collection of small tools, mostly for my own personal use. 
These have been developed pro re nata for classes, pet projects, professional projects (published only as permitted), etc. 
These are one-off helper-script style tools. 
Depending on how rushed I am when I commit them, you may be left wanting for documentation and feature 
requests will take a fairly low priority for me. 
That being said, if you find these tools useful and want to see an improvement, certainly file an issue, I don't mind.
